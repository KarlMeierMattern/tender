Some additional considerations:
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for network issues, parsing errors, and site changes.
Rate Limiting: Consider implementing rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the target site.
Caching: Implement caching to store results temporarily and reduce load on the target site.
Authentication: The site might require login - you'll need to handle that in your scraper.
Legal Considerations: Make sure to check the website's terms of service regarding scraping.
